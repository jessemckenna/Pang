# Pang
SFML 2.4.2 Pong clone

"Pang" is a pong clone created in SFML and C++ from the tutorial "Game From Scratch":
http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition.aspx

This version is adapted from the original tutorial to use SFML 2.4.2 and includes all elements described in the tutorial, plus additional functionality to make the game complete (made ball bounce off AI paddle and tweaked AI paddle behavior).
